# One of the main things this file does is correctly give the full path to the following directories regardless of
# install type :
#   install_root:  The top-level directory where Scalyr is currently installed.
#
# There are several different ways we can be running, and this files has to give the correct values for each of them.
# For example, we could just be running out of the source tree as checked into github or we can be running
# out of some package such as Deb, Rpm, Msi for Windows and etc. We handle of these cases.
#
# Example layouts for different install types:
#
# Running from source:
#   Here the install root is ~/scalyr-agent-2 and the package root is ~/scalyr-agent-2/scalyr-agent
#
# Install using tarball:
#   Here the install root is the path to the extracted tarball.
#
# Install using rpm/deb/kubernetes/docker package:
#   Here the install root is /usr/share/scalyr-agent-2.
#
# Install using msi package for Windows:
#   Here the install root is C:\Program Files (x86)\Scalyr\
#
# In spite of the package type, the internal structure of the package is the same:
#   VERSION: The package version file.
#   package_info.json: File which contains the type of the installed package. Agent looks for this file during the
#       initialization in the directory of the "scalyr_agent" package in its source code. According to the type that has
#       been read from the file, agent has to find its essential paths such logs, config, etc.
#       This file is not presented in the repository and is generated during the build process.
#       NOTE: When package uses a frozen binary, this file is embedded to the executable.
#
#   py/: Directory with the source code of the agent. Only used in the Kubernetes and Docker images to keep them
#       architecture-independent. Other builds use frozen binaries.
#
#   bin/: The directory with executables. For the majority of the package types, it contains frozen binaries of the
#       agent. In case of Kubernetes or Docker it contains symlinks to agent executable scripts in the source code which
#       is located in the 'py' folder.
#   certs/: Certificates directory.
#   monitors/: The folder for custom monitors.
#   misc/: Miscellaneous files.


# Indicates if this code was compiled into a single executable via PyInstaller.  If that's the case,
# then we cannot rely on __file__ and the source is kind of through into the same directory.
