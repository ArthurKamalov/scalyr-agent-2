# This script is meant to be executed by the instance of the 'agent_build_refactored.tools.runner.RunnerStep' class.
# Every RunnerStep provides common environment variables to its script:
#   SOURCE_ROOT: Path to the projects root.
#   STEP_OUTPUT_PATH: Path to the step's output directory.
#
# This script downloads and builds Python libraries that are required by the agent.
# it produces two directories:
#     - dev_libs - root for all project requirement libraries. Mainly supposed to be used in various build and testing
#         tools and images.
#     - agent_libs: root for the agent_libs package. It contains only libraries that are required by the agent.
